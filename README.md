Useful R Packages, DSSG 2014
===============

## Introduction

Introduction to R packages that will be useful for Data Science for Social Good projects




## The Software
1. **R**:  This is the software that handles data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.  Download a copy [here](http://cran.r-project.org/).
2. **RStudio**: This is an integrated development environment (that is, it brings the source code, output screen, debugging tools, etc. together).  It provides an attractive, manipulable, easy-to-use interface to R.  Download a copy [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).





## Load Data

R likes CSVs and tab-delimited files, but some of your partners will share their data in other formats.  R has many packages to read other data formats.  I provide examples for several in the code:

* **foreign**: 
* **sas7bdat**: 
* **sqldf**: http://files.meetup.com/1625815/crug_sqldf_05-01-2013.pdf
* **XML**: 
* **rjson**: 

xlsx



## Missing Data

* **Amelia II**





## Visualizing Data

### ggplot2
 
**Additional resources**: [Tables2Graphs](http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php)
